## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive layout

### What I learned

I learned a bit more about using flex display and had less difficulty manipulating the items on the page. For the first time, I managed to make the page responsive for smaller screens and I am pleased with the result. I enjoyed working with the background image, even though I didn't manage to place certain elements exactly where I wanted them. However, I feel I came close.

```css
body {
    background-image: url("images/bg-mobile.svg");
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: top;
    background-color: hsl(255, 37%, 49%);
    background-size: 100%;
}
```

### Continued development

I will focus more on how I can efficiently move the items on the page while maintaining responsiveness for smaller screens.
